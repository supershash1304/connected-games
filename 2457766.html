                <b>Choosing the Right Unity Version:</b>
                <br>Unity is my engine of choice because of its versatility.But picking the right version is 
                <br>important as I have to adjust it as per my teammates.I installed it via the Unity Hub, 
                <br>which makes managing different projects and versions easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Setting Up My Development Environment:</b>
                <br>Once Unity was installed, I needed the right tools:
                <br><br>Visual Code : For C# scripting on my MacBook Air .
                <br>Git: For uploading data files,codes and game programming blogs.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dividing Work:</b>
                <br>As a programmer I am collaborating with my teammate to divide the work.
            </p>
           <p>
            <b>Planning the Game Workflow:</b>
            <br>Rather than jumping straight into coding, I decided to structure my workflow:
            <br><br>Concept & Design: Deciding type of game my team is making 
            <br>Prototyping: Creating a simple scene with placeholder assets to test movement and interactions.
            <br>Core Mechanics Development: Deciding what physics, AI, and game logic can be used.
            <br>

                <b>Taking upon the server side implementation task</b>
                <br>Creating a scene in unity for player connections page
                <br><b>Username Input:</b>
                <br>The script retrieves the username from a TMP_InputField and 
                <br>assigns it to PhotonNetwork.NickName when the "Connect" button is clicked.
               
                <br><b>Connection to Photon Server:</b>
                <br>Upon clicking the "Connect" button, the script initiates a connection to the Photon
                <br>server using PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings() and updates the button text to "connecting...".
                <br>
                 <br><b>Scene Transition on Connection:</b>
                <br>Once the connection to the Photon master server is established 
                <br>(OnConnectedToMaster callback), the script automatically loads the "Lobby" scene.

            <b>Implementing the multiplayer server creation process</b>
            <p>
            <b>1. Set Up the multiplayer UI</b>
            </p>
<br>Create a Canvas:
<br>Right-click in the Hierarchy > UI > Canvas.
<br>This will automatically create an EventSystem as well.
<br>Add Buttons:
<br>Right-click on the Canvas > UI > Button.
<br>Create three buttons:
<br>Host Button: For starting the game as both the host and a player.
<br>Server Button: For starting the game as a dedicated server.
<br>Client Button: For joining the game as a client.
<br>Label the Buttons:
<br>Select each button and change its text (in the Text child object) to "Host", "Server", and "Client".
<br>Position the Buttons:
<br>Use the RectTransform tool to position the buttons neatly on the screen.
        </p>
    <p>
            <b>2.Assign the Script to the UI</b>

<br>Attach the Script:
<br>Select the Canvas in the Hierarchy.
<br>Add the MultiplayerUI script as a component.
<br>Assign Buttons:
<br>Drag the corresponding buttons from the Hierarchy into the hostButton, serverButton, 
<br>and clientButton fields in the MultiplayerUI script.
