            <b>Choosing the Right Unity Version:</b>
            <br>Unity is my engine of choice because of its versatility. But picking the right version is 
            <br>important as I have to adjust it as per my teammates. I installed it via the Unity Hub, 
            <br>which makes managing different projects and versions easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Setting Up My Development Environment:</b>
            <br>Once Unity was installed, I needed the right tools:
            <br><br>Visual Studio Code: For C# scripting on my MacBook Air
            <br>Cause Visual Studio isn't supported on Mac Anymore ðŸ˜‘.
            <br>Git: For uploading data files, codes, and game programming blogs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Dividing Work:</b>
            <br>As a programmer, I am collaborating with my teammate to divide the work.
            <br>Dividing the work into 2 parts
            <br>1) Multiplayer Server Creation & Server side Implementation
            <br>2) Game Physics and Logic
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Also Choosing the work both the programmers are comfortable to do.
            <br>I wanted to do something i ve not done before which is Multiplayer server implementation.
            <br> Like to Challenge myself !!!! ðŸ˜‡

            <b>Setting up the Photon Unity networking:</b>
            <br>Steps:
            <br>1) Using the Unity Package manager to install the photon networking services.
            <br>2) Setting up a server on Photon Unity Networking website.
            <br>3) Adding the App ID from the created website to Unity for integrating the project with the server.

            <br>Creating a scene in Unity for player connections page.
            <br><b>Username Input:</b>
            <br>The script retrieves the username from a TMP_InputField and 
            <br>assigns it to PhotonNetwork.NickName when the "Connect" button is clicked.
            <br><b>Connection to Photon Server:</b>
            <br>Upon clicking the "Connect" button, the script initiates a connection to the Photon
            <br>server using PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings() and updates the button text to "connecting...".
            <br>
            <br><b>Scene Transition on Connection:</b>
            <br>Once the connection to the Photon master server is established, 
            <br>(OnConnectedToMaster callback), the script automatically loads the "Lobby" scene.

            <br>1. Created a UI Panel named LobbyPanel to serve as the main multiplayer lobby screen.
            <br>2. Added a <span style="color: green">TMP_InputField</span> for users to type the room name before creating it.
            <br>3. Placed a "Create Room" Button that calls the <span style="color: green">OnClickCreate()</span> Method.
            <br>4. Included a Scroll View to list all available rooms using a vertical layout.
            <br>5. Used a RoomItem prefab to visually represent each room in the room list.
            <br>6. Connected the lobby panel to Photon callbacks to update the room list in real-time.

            <br>3. Used a Scroll View to display player items in the room.
            <br>4. Instantiated PlayerItem prefabs to show each player's name and avatar. 
            <br>5. Enabled the Play button for the MasterClient when at least one player is present.

             <b>MAP DESIGN AND UI DESIGNS STILL NOT PROVIDED BY THE DESIGN TEAMðŸ˜”</b>
             <br><br><b>GIT MERGING:</b>
             <br>Sorting Conflicts while Merging both programmer's work (the branches in Github)
             <br><br><b>Conflicts:</b>
             <br>1)Simultaneous edits to the same methods (TakeDamage(), OnTriggerEnter(), [PunRPC] declarations) caused Git conflicts.
             <br>2)Identical method names like TakeDamageRPC() appeared in multiple scripts or more than once in a single file.
             <br>3)Serialized fields and component references were modified differently across branches, creating clashes in .cs, .prefab, .meta, and .unity files.
             <br>4)PhotonView components were assigned differently in each branch, causing mismatches and broken references.
             <br>5)Formatting discrepancies (spaces, comments, Debug.Log()) triggered unnecessary merge conflicts.
             <br>6)Game logic changes and UI updates weren't in sync, leading to UI elements referencing outdated or unsynced gameplay data.
             <br><br><b>Issues:</b>
             <br>1)Lack of coordination on modifying shared scripts and core gameplay logic.
             <br>2)No standard naming or placement conventions for RPC methods, leading to duplication.
             <br>3)Serialized Unity files (like prefabs/scenes) are sensitive to even minor changes, and Git can't auto-merge them reliably.
             <br>4)Inconsistent PhotonView assignments across branches broke prefab consistency.
             <br>5)Different team members had varying coding styles, which Git misread as functional changes.
             <br>6)Gameplay updates and UI improvements were developed in parallel without shared state handling or abstraction layers.
             <br><br><b>How Everything was Fixed:</b>
             <br>1)Carefully merged script logic by isolating network-related code inside [PunRPC] methods and guarding them with photonView.IsMine where needed.
             <br>2)Unified duplicated methods: e.g., TakeDamageRPC() was defined in only one authoritative script per object type.
             <br>3)Manually resolved .cs conflicts, then fixed broken links in Unity Editor for .prefab, .meta, and .unity files.
             <br>4)Used UnityYAMLMerge and manually reassigned PhotonView components after the merge to restore prefab integrity.
             <br>5)Applied a consistent code formatting standard before merging to reduce formatting-related conflicts.
             <br>6)Introduced a layered structure:
                <br>Gameplay scripts (e.g., Health.cs, BossAI.cs) own and update the state.
                <br>UI scripts (e.g., HealthBarUI.cs) only read and reflect the synced state.
