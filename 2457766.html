            <b>Choosing the Right Unity Version:</b>
            <br>Unity is my engine of choice because of its versatility. But picking the right version is 
            <br>important as I have to adjust it as per my teammates. I installed it via the Unity Hub, 
            <br>which makes managing different projects and versions easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Setting Up My Development Environment:</b>
            <br>Once Unity was installed, I needed the right tools:
            <br><br>Visual Studio Code: For C# scripting on my MacBook Air
            <br>Cause Visual Studio isn't supported on Mac Anymore ðŸ˜‘.
            <br>Git: For uploading data files, codes, and game programming blogs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Dividing Work:</b>
            <br>As a programmer, I am collaborating with my teammate to divide the work.
            <br>Dividing the work into 2 parts
            <br>1) Multiplayer Server Creation & Server side Implementation
            <br>2) Game Physics and Logic
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Also Choosing the work both the programmers are comfortable to do.
            <br>I wanted to do something i ve not done before which is Multiplayer server implementation.
            <br> Like to Challenge myself !!!! ðŸ˜‡

            <br>Steps:
            <br>1) Using the Unity Package manager to install the photon networking services.
            <br>2) Setting up a server on Photon Unity Networking website.
            <br>3) Adding the App ID from the created website to Unity for integrating the project with the server.

            <b>Taking upon the server-side implementation task:</b>
            <br>Creating a scene in Unity for player connections page.
            <br><b>Username Input:</b>
            <br>The script retrieves the username from a TMP_InputField and 
            <br>assigns it to PhotonNetwork.NickName when the "Connect" button is clicked.
            <br><b>Connection to Photon Server:</b>
            <br>Upon clicking the "Connect" button, the script initiates a connection to the Photon
            <br>server using PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings() and updates the button text to "connecting...".
            <br>
            <br><b>Scene Transition on Connection:</b>
            <br>Once the connection to the Photon master server is established, 
            <br>(OnConnectedToMaster callback), the script automatically loads the "Lobby" scene.

            Created A lobbyManager Script to Incorporate the lobby Panel and Room panel with other functionalities.
            <br><b>Creation process of lobby panel:</b>
            <br>Creating a scene in Unity to initialize the Lobby and Room panels.
            <br>1. Created a UI Panel named LobbyPanel to serve as the main multiplayer lobby screen.
            <br>2. Added a <span style="color: green">TMP_InputField</span> for users to type the room name before creating it.
            <br>3. Placed a "Create Room" Button that calls the <span style="color: green">OnClickCreate()</span> Method.
            <br>4. Included a Scroll View to list all available rooms using a vertical layout.
            <br>5. Used a RoomItem prefab to visually represent each room in the room list.
            <br>6. Connected the lobby panel to Photon callbacks to update the room list in real-time.

            <b>Creation process of Room panel & Character selection:</b>
            <br>1. Created a RoomPanel UI with player list display and a "Leave Room" button. 
            <br>2. Added a TMP_Text to show the current room name.  
            <br>3. Used a Scroll View to display player items in the room.
            <br>4. Instantiated PlayerItem prefabs to show each player's name and avatar. 
            <br>5. Enabled the Play button for the MasterClient when at least one player is present.

            <br>2) Updating the room list when changes occur using OnRoomListUpdate.
            <br>3) Keeps the lobby UI in sync with real-time player and room data in Photon multiplayer.

            <br>2) OnClickLeaveRoom is called when the player chooses to leave the current room using PhotonNetwork.LeaveRoom().
            <br>3) OnLeftRoom handles cleanup by hiding the room panel, showing the lobby panel, and clearing all player UI elements.

        <b>Room panel:</b>
        <br>1. Displayed a PlayerItem prefab for each player in the room panel UI.
        <br>2. Included left and right arrow buttons on each PlayerItem to cycle through avatars.
        <br>3. Stored the selected avatar index in Photon player custom properties.
        <br>4. Synced avatar changes across all clients using OnPlayerPropertiesUpdate().
        <br>5. Updated the avatar image on each PlayerItem based on the selected index.

            <b>Methodologies of Avatar selection And Script</b>
            <br><b>Photon Custom Properties</b>
            <br>Each player has a playerAvatar index stored in Photonâ€™s CustomProperties, which is automatically 
            <br>synchronized across all clients in the room.
            <br><br><b>UI-Based Selection with Arrows</b>
            <br>Players can click left/right arrow buttons to cycle through available avatar sprites. These inputs update their 
            <br>playerAvatar index and immediately broadcast the change.
            <br><br><b>Real-Time Synchronization</b>
            <br>Photon invokes OnPlayerPropertiesUpdate, which triggers the UpdatePlayerItem method to update each 
            <br>player's UI with their newly selected avatar.
            <br><br><b>Visual Display in Room UI</b>
            <br>The selected avatar (a sprite from a predefined list) is visually shown next to the playerâ€™s name in the lobby 
            <br>room panel, providing clear feedback to all players.

            <br>Also A quick note , Its week 6 and I havent recieved any design details from the designers.
            <br>Next I will implement the Player Spawner and SpawnPoints in the game scene , instantiating the players from the lobby.

         <p>
             <b>Week 7</b>
             <br><b>MAP DESIGN AND UI DESIGNS STILL NOT PROVIDED BY THE DESIGN TEAMðŸ˜”</b>
             <br><br><b>Implementing the Player Spawner and SpawnPoints in the Game Scene</b>
             <br><b>Spawn Points Setup</b>
             <br>Multiple Transform points were placed in the scene to represent potential player spawn locations.
             <br>These were assigned to the PlayerSpawner script via the Unity Inspector for dynamic random selection.
             <br><br><b>Prefab Usage</b>
             <br>The player character (X Bot) was converted into a prefab and placed in the Resources folder.
             <br>This allows runtime instantiation over the network using PhotonNetwork.Instantiate.
             <br><br><b>Photon Ownership and Network Instantiation</b>
             <br>Only the local client executes the instantiation using:â€¨csharp
             <br>GameObject player = PhotonNetwork.Instantiate(prefabName, spawnPoint.position, Quaternion.identity);
             <br>This ensures each player is only responsible for controlling their own character.
             <br><br><b>Random Spawn Point Logic</b>
             <br>On scene load, a random Transform from the spawnPoints[] array is selected:
             <br>int index = Random.Range(0, spawnPoints.Length); Transform spawnPoint = spawnPoints[index];  
             <br><br><b>Camera Follow Setup</b>
             <br>The main camera uses a custom CameraFollow script or a Cinemachine FreeLook camera.
             <br>Upon instantiation, the camera's follow and look-at targets are set to the spawned player:
             <br>cinemachineCam.Follow = player.transform; cinemachineCam.LookAt = player.transform;
             <br><br><b>Health UI Assignment</b>             
             <br>Only the local player's health bar UI is assigned,This avoids syncing UI data across the network.
             <br><br><b>PhotonView Check for Local Control</b>      
             <br>photonView.IsMine is used to ensure camera assignment and UI logic only run for the local player

            <br><b>Week 8</b>
             <br><b>Finally got a Rough Prototype of the map , which is not related to the game theme , also still no updates on any UI and sound design</b>
             <br><br><b>GIT MERGING:</b>
             <br>Sorting Conflicts while Merging both programmer's work (the branches in Github)
             <br><br><b>Conflicts:</b>
             <br>1)Simultaneous edits to the same methods (TakeDamage(), OnTriggerEnter(), [PunRPC] declarations) caused Git conflicts.
             <br>2)Identical method names like TakeDamageRPC() appeared in multiple scripts or more than once in a single file.
             <br>3)Serialized fields and component references were modified differently across branches, creating clashes in .cs, .prefab, .meta, and .unity files.
             <br>4)PhotonView components were assigned differently in each branch, causing mismatches and broken references.
             <br>5)Formatting discrepancies (spaces, comments, Debug.Log()) triggered unnecessary merge conflicts.
             <br>6)Game logic changes and UI updates weren't in sync, leading to UI elements referencing outdated or unsynced gameplay data.
             <br><br><b>Issues:</b>
             <br>1)Lack of coordination on modifying shared scripts and core gameplay logic.
             <br>2)No standard naming or placement conventions for RPC methods, leading to duplication.
             <br>3)Serialized Unity files (like prefabs/scenes) are sensitive to even minor changes, and Git can't auto-merge them reliably.
             <br>4)Inconsistent PhotonView assignments across branches broke prefab consistency.
             <br>5)Different team members had varying coding styles, which Git misread as functional changes.
             <br>6)Gameplay updates and UI improvements were developed in parallel without shared state handling or abstraction layers.
             <br><br><b>How Everything was Fixed:</b>
             <br>1)Carefully merged script logic by isolating network-related code inside [PunRPC] methods and guarding them with photonView.IsMine where needed.
             <br>2)Unified duplicated methods: e.g., TakeDamageRPC() was defined in only one authoritative script per object type.
             <br>3)Manually resolved .cs conflicts, then fixed broken links in Unity Editor for .prefab, .meta, and .unity files.
             <br>4)Used UnityYAMLMerge and manually reassigned PhotonView components after the merge to restore prefab integrity.
             <br>5)Applied a consistent code formatting standard before merging to reduce formatting-related conflicts.
             <br>6)Introduced a layered structure:
                <br>Gameplay scripts (e.g., Health.cs, BossAI.cs) own and update the state.
                <br>UI scripts (e.g., HealthBarUI.cs) only read and reflect the synced state.

        <p>
            <b>The second programmer set up the rough map BUT UNFORTUNATELY DID ALL THE SCRIPTING FOR SINGLEPLAYER, 
                also still no updates on any UI and sound design,
            </b>
            <p>
    <br><br><b>Changing InGame Player, AI, Weapon, Enemy & Boss scripts created by the second programmer to be multiplayer and Photon ready</b>

    <br><br><b>1. Health.cs (Player)</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>

    <br>* Introduced SetHealth(current, max) with animation via Mathf.Lerp.
    <br>* Fixed SetMaxHealth() to be properly called and safe from divide-by-zero.
    <br>* Updated via Update() method to show smooth visual updates.

    <br><br><b>3. BossHealth.cs</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Manages boss HP, handles phase change, and death logic.
    <br><br><b>Problems Fixed:</b>
    <br>* Health didnâ€™t sync across players.
    <br>* Multiple players couldnâ€™t damage the boss.
    <br>* Death animation not visible across clients.
    <br><br><b>Fixes Made:</b>

    <br>* Added OnPhotonSerializeView for live syncing currentHealth.
    <br>* Triggered RPC_BossDeathVisuals via photonView.RPC() to all clients.
    <br>* Death trigger added to animator and destroy delayed.

    <br><br><b>4. BossHealthBarUI.cs</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Display boss health bar visually using Image Fill.
    <br><br><b>Problems Fixed:</b>
    <br>* Boss HP bar didnâ€™t match across players.
    <br>* Didnâ€™t hide after boss death.
    <br><br><b>Fixes Made:</b>
    <br>* Automatically finds boss with tag "Boss" if not assigned.
    <br>* Smooth fill amount animation.
    <br>* Option to hide bar if boss dies (via callback added to BossHealth or BossSpawner).

    <br><br><b>5. BossAI.cs</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Controls movement, attack behavior, and player targeting.
    <br><br><b>Problems Fixed:</b>
    <br>* Boss kept targeting dead players.
    <br>* Only MasterClient saw attacks.

    <br>* Only host took damage from boss.
    <br><br><b>Fixes Made:</b>
    <br>* Only PhotonNetwork.IsMasterClient controls logic.
    <br>* FindNextAlivePlayer() updated to skip dead players.
    <br>* Boss uses PhotonNetwork.Instantiate to spawn projectiles.
    <br>* Boss death now calls RPC_BossDie() and disables NavMeshAgent and animation logic.

    <br><br><b>6. Projectile.cs</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Shoots forward, detects player on hit.
    <br><br><b>Problems Fixed:</b>
    <br>* Players didnâ€™t take damage.
    <br>* Boss projectiles didnâ€™t sync damage properly.

    <br>* Added hasHit check to prevent multiple hits.
    <br>* Calls targetView.RPC("RPC_TakeDamage", targetView.Owner) for players.
    <br>* Calls TakeDamageRPC() for bosses.

    <br><br><b>9. PlayerSpawner.cs</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Spawns local player and camera assignment.
    <br><br><b>Problems Fixed:</b>
    <br>* Didnâ€™t assign health bar properly.
    <br>* Camera didnâ€™t follow player consistently.
    <br><br><b>Fixes Made:</b>
    <br>* Loads "X Bot" prefab from Resources.
    <br>* Finds and assigns HealthBarUI to local playerâ€™s health script.
    <br>* Sets camera to follow photonView.IsMine player.

    <br><br><b>10. FallDetector.cs</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Kills players who fall below a threshold.
    <br><br><b>Problems Fixed:</b>
    <br>* Used undefined MaxHealth property.
    <br>* Didnâ€™t call proper RPC-based damage method.
    <br><br><b>Fixes Made:</b>
    <br>* Replaced health.MaxHealth with health.GetCurrentHealth() or maxHealth.
    <br>* Uses health.TakeDamage(9999) to ensure death.

    <br><br><b>Final Notes:</b>
    <br>* Photon RPCs were applied correctly to every remote interaction.
    <br>* Only MasterClient can change core game state like boss health.
    <br>* All players now see accurate HP values, ragdolls, death, and projectiles.
    <br>* Health bars now visually decrease and sync across all clients.
    <br>* Death animations now play properly after fixing missing animator triggers.

    <br><br><b>Death & Win Scene Flow Implementation (Multiplayer-Photon)</b>

    <br><br><b>1. Death Screen Flow</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>Handle local player death by showing a UI, leaving the Photon room, and transitioning back to the lobby.
    <br><br><b>Flow:</b>
    <br>* Each playerâ€™s character has a Health.cs script attached.
    <br>* When currentHealth drops to 0, isDead is set to true and ragdoll physics are enabled.
    <br>* If photonView.IsMine, the DeathScreenUI (tagged "DeathUI") is activated.
    <br>* After 5 seconds, PhotonNetwork.LeaveRoom() is called.
    <br>* RoomExitHandler.cs listens for OnLeftRoom() and loads "ConnectToServer" scene.
    <br><br><b>Result:</b>
    <br>* Only the dead player exits the room.
    <br>* Other players continue playing uninterrupted.
    <br>* Transition is smooth and synced.

    <br><br><b>2. Win Scene Flow</b>
    <br><br><b>Original Purpose:</b>
    <br>End the game for all players when the boss is defeated and transition them to a shared win screen.
    <br><br><b>Flow:</b>
    <br>* BossHealth.cs manages a shared health pool via PhotonView.
    <br>* When health reaches 0, Die() is called.
    <br>* All players receive a visual via RPC_BossDeathVisuals().
    <br>* Only the MasterClient calls PhotonNetwork.LoadLevel("WinScene").
    <br>* PhotonNetwork.AutomaticallySyncScene ensures all clients load the same scene.
    <br>* WinSceneHandler.cs waits 3 seconds then loads "ConnectToServer" scene.

    <br><br><b>Result:</b>
    <br>* All players transition together to the WinScene.
    <br>* Dedicated win screen is shown.
    <br>* Match resets cleanly for a new session.
